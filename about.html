    <p>Hi there! i'm a customer relations and care specialist with 4 years of experience
     who loves getting things done. As a business manager, i developed skills in strategic
     planning, team leadership, and project management.
     <br>
     <br>i'm also currently learning to be a software engineer, and i'm excited about the potential 
     technology to solve problems and create new opportunities.
     when i'm not working or studying i enjoy getting creative with crafts, especially tailoring
     & beading. in fact, i've turned my hobby into a side business and have developed skills in sales and 
     maintenance.
     <br>
    <br> i'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, and i'm eager to connect 
      with like-minded professionals who share my passion for innovation and creativity.
     let's work together to achieve great things!
